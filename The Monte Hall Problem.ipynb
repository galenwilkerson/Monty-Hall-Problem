    "# The Monte Hall Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. Here's an intuitive explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Imagine you're on a game show. There are three doors. Behind one door is a car (the prize you want), and behind the other two doors are goats.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Your Choice**: You pick one of the three doors, say Door 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the other two doors, say Door 3, revealing a goat. Now, you know Door 3 has a goat.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Decision Point**: The host then gives you a choice: stick with your original pick (Door 1) or switch to the remaining unopened door (Door 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial Probability**: When you first pick a door, there is a 1/3 chance you picked the car and a 2/3 chance you picked a goat.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **After Host's Reveal**: The host's action of revealing a goat doesn't change the initial probabilities. It just gives you more information. If you initially picked a goat (which has a 2/3 chance), switching will always win you the car. If you initially picked the car (which has a 1/3 chance), switching will lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, **switching doors** gives you a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while **staying** with your initial choice gives you only a 1/3 chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, **it's always better to switch!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monty Hall problem can be analyzed using Bayesian statistics to update the probabilities based on new information. Here's how it relates:"

    "# Key Insight:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the key insight of the Monty Hall problem in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Probability:\n",
    "When you first pick a door, there are three possible scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You Pick the Car**: There is 1 car and 2 goats. The probability of picking the car is:\n",
    "   $$ P(\\text{Car}) = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **You Pick a Goat**: There are 2 goats. The probability of picking a goat is:\n",
    "   $$ P(\\text{Goat}) = \\frac{2}{3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Host's Action:\n",
    "The host knows what is behind each door and always reveals a goat behind one of the two doors you did not pick. This action provides additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### After Host's Reveal:\n",
    "Now, let's consider the scenarios based on whether you initially picked a car or a goat:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **If You Initially Picked the Car (Probability 1/3)**:\n",
    "   - The host reveals one of the goats.\n",
    "   - If you switch, you will lose because the remaining door will have the other goat.\n",
    "   - Probability of winning if you stay:\n",
    "     $$ P(\\text{Win if Stay | Picked Car}) = 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **If You Initially Picked a Goat (Probability 2/3)**:\n",
    "   - The host reveals the only remaining goat.\n",
    "   - If you switch, you will win because the remaining door will have the car.\n",
    "   - Probability of winning if you switch:\n",
    "     $$ P(\\text{Win if Switch | Picked Goat}) = 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updated Probabilities:\n",
    "After the host reveals a goat, the probabilities of winning by staying or switching are updated based on the initial probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability of Winning if Staying**:\n",
    "  - You win if your initial choice was the car.\n",
    "  - Initial probability of picking the car was 1/3.\n",
    "  - So, the probability of winning if you stay is:\n",
    "    $$ P(\\text{Win if Stay}) = P(\\text{Car}) = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability of Winning if Switching**:\n",
    "  - You win if your initial choice was a goat.\n",
    "  - Initial probability of picking a goat was 2/3.\n",
    "  - So, the probability of winning if you switch is:\n",
    "    $$ P(\\text{Win if Switch}) = P(\\text{Goat}) = \\frac{2}{3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Therefore:\n",
    "- **Switching doors gives you a 2/3 chance of winning the car**, because if your initial pick was a goat (which is 2/3 of the time), switching will always win you the car.\n",
    "- **Staying with your initial choice gives you only a 1/3 chance of winning**, because if your initial pick was the car (which is 1/3 of the time), staying will win you the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "**It's always better to switch!**\n"

    "# Bayesian Approach\n",
    "Bayesian statistics involves updating the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prior Probabilities**:\n",
    "   Initially, you have a prior probability for each door hiding the car:\n",
    "   - $P(Car \\,|\\, Door 1) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n",
    "   - $P(Car \\,|\\, Door 2) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n",
    "   - $P(Car \\,|\\, Door 3) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **New Information**:\n",
    "   The host opens one of the doors (say, Door 3) to reveal a goat. This action provides new information that must be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Likelihood**:\n",
    "   The likelihood is the probability of the observed data (the host opening Door 3 and revealing a goat) under each hypothesis. The host will always choose a goat, knowing the locations of the car and goats:\n",
    "   - If the car is behind Door 1, the host could open Door 2 or Door 3. Since the host opened Door 3:\n",
    "     $$P(Host \\, opens \\, Door 3 \\,|\\, Car \\, behind \\, Door 1) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n",
    "   - If the car is behind Door 2, the host must open Door 3:\n",
    "     $$P(Host \\, opens \\, Door 3 \\,|\\, Car \\, behind \\, Door 2) = 1$$\n",
    "   - If the car is behind Door 3, the host cannot open Door 3:\n",
    "     $$P(Host \\, opens \\, Door 3 \\,|\\, Car \\, behind \\, Door 3) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Posterior Probabilities**:\n",
    "   Using Bayes' theorem, you update the probabilities based on this new information:\n",
    "   $$P(Car \\, behind \\, Door \\, i \\,|\\, Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3) = \\frac{P(Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3 \\,|\\, Car \\, behind \\, Door \\, i) \\times P(Car \\, behind \\, Door \\, i)}{P(Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   The denominator, $P(Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3)$, is the total probability of the host opening Door 3, which normalizes the probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Let's calculate these probabilities:\n",
    "   - For Door 1:\n",
    "     $$P(Car \\, behind \\, Door \\, 1 \\,|\\, Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3}}{P(Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3)} = \\frac{1}{6 \\times P(Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3)}$$\n",
    "   - For Door 2:\n",
    "     $$P(Car \\, behind \\, Door \\, 2 \\,|\\, Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3) = \\frac{1 \\times \\frac{1}{3}}{P(Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3)} = \\frac{1}{3 \\times P(Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3)}$$\n",
    "   - For Door 3:\n",
    "     $$P(Car \\, behind \\, Door \\, 3 \\,|\\, Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3) = \\frac{0 \\times \\frac{1}{3}}{P(Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3)} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   The denominator is the sum of these terms:\n",
    "   $$P(Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Now, updating the probabilities:\n",
    "   - For Door 1:\n",
    "     $$P(Car \\, behind \\, Door \\, 1 \\,|\\, Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{6}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 2 = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n",
    "   - For Door 2:\n",
    "     $$P(Car \\, behind \\, Door \\, 2 \\,|\\, Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 2 = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n",
    "   - For Door 3:\n",
    "     $$P(Car \\, behind \\, Door \\, 3 \\,|\\, Host \\, opens \\, Door \\, 3) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- The probability that the car is behind Door 1 (if you stay) is 1/3.\n",
    "- The probability that the car is behind Door 2 (if you switch) is 2/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayesian reasoning, the updated probabilities confirm that switching doors increases your chance of winning from 1/3 to 2/3. This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem to update your beliefs based on new evidence."
