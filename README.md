# Monty Hall Problem

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates and simulates the Monty Hall Problem, a famous probability puzzle based on a game show scenario.

## Introduction

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle named after the host of the television game show "Let's Make a Deal." The problem is as follows:

1. **Setup**: You are a contestant on a game show. There are three doors: behind one door is a car (the prize you want), and behind the other two doors are goats.

2. **Your Choice**: You pick one of the three doors, say Door 1.

3. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the other two doors, say Door 3, revealing a goat. Now you know Door 3 has a goat.

4. **Decision Point**: The host then gives you a choice: stick with your original pick (Door 1) or switch to the remaining unopened door (Door 2).

The counterintuitive solution to the problem is that switching doors gives you a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while staying with your initial choice gives you only a 1/3 chance. This notebook demonstrates this principle through simulation and visualization.

## Repository Contents

- `The Monty Hall Problem.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the simulation and visualization of the Monty Hall problem.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Monty-Hall-Problem.git
    cd Monty-Hall-Problem
    ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
    Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook and matplotlib installed. If not, you can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook matplotlib numpy
    ```

3. **Run the notebook**:
    Launch Jupyter Notebook in the repository directory and open `The Monty Hall Problem.ipynb`:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default web browser. Navigate to `The Monty Hall Problem.ipynb` and run the cells to see the simulation and visualizations.
